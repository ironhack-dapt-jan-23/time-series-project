# Times Series Project

Time series analysis is the study of data points that are collected over time, typically at regular intervals. It can help businesses understand trends and patterns in their data to make informed decisions. In this project, we will be analyzing time series data from a retail store to understand its sales patterns, forecast future sales, and identify any underlying factors affecting sales.

## Instructions

Steps to follow during this project on time series:  

1. Identify a suitable data set: Look for a data set that contains time-stamped data points, such as weekly or daily sales, stock prices, or weather data. The data set should cover a sufficient period to allow for time series analysis and forecasting. Examples of dataset you can use are [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data) with climate data or [this one](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/htagholdings/property-sales) that is about house property sales.  
2. Data cleaning and preparation: Clean and prepare your data by removing any missing or erroneous data points.  
3. Transform the data into a format suitable for analysis.  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform exploratory data analysis to visualize the data and identify any trends or patterns. 
5. Use time series plots and other visualization tools to understand the underlying patterns in your data.  
6. Time series analysis: Use statistical techniques such as moving averages, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA models to identify any underlying factors affecting your data. Perform decomposition analysis to separate the data into its seasonal, trend, and residual components.  
7. Forecasting: Use time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA and exponential smoothing to predict future values of your data. Evaluate the accuracy of your forecasts using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE).  
8. Extra Activity: Identification of Factors Affecting Data: Use regression analysis to determine the relationship between your data and variables such as promotions, marketing campaigns, and external factors such as economic conditions. Use techniques such as correlation analysis and regression models to identify the most significant factors affecting your data.
9. Visualization and Reporting: Present your findings using visualizations such as line charts and scatterplots. Prepare a report summarizing your analysis and recommendations for improving the data. Your report should include your forecasts for future values, the factors affecting the data, and recommendations for improving the data.

Remember, time series analysis requires careful attention to detail and a solid understanding of statistical methods. Ensure you have adequate time and resources to complete the project, and seek help from your instructor or other resources if you encounter challenges. Finally, have fun and enjoy the process of exploring your data and discovering insights!

## Project ideas  
We know this is a completely new topic to learn, so below are some project ideas to get started:  
1. **Stock price forecasting:** Use time series analysis to predict the future prices of a particular stock or a portfolio of stocks. You can use historical stock prices data and apply techniques like moving averages, ARIMA, and exponential smoothing to forecast future prices.  
2. **Temperature forecasting**: Use time series analysis to predict temperature trends and patterns over a certain period of time. You can use historical temperature data and apply techniques like ARIMA and seasonal decomposition to forecast future temperature patterns.   
3. **Sales forecasting**: Use time series analysis to predict future sales trends and patterns for a particular product or service. You can use historical sales data and apply techniques like exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and trend analysis to forecast future sales.  
4. **Website traffic analysis**: Use time series analysis to analyze website traffic patterns over time. You can use historical website traffic data and apply techniques like seasonality analysis, trend analysis, and anomaly detection to identify traffic patterns and forecast future traffic.
5. **Energy consumption forecasting**: Use time series analysis to predict future energy consumption patterns for a particular region. You can use historical energy consumption data and apply techniques like ARIMA, seasonal decomposition, and regression analysis to forecast future energy consumption patterns.
